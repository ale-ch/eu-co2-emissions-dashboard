# EU CO2 Emissions Dashboard
Visualization of CO2 emissions by country in the European Union, from 1990 to 2021. 
I suggest to explore it with PowerBI for more interactivity and better insight. 

Data was collected at: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/data-viewers/greenhouse-gases-viewer
